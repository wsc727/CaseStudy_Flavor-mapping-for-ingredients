Flavor Mapping Project 

Description: The aim of this project is to demonstrate the potential of flavor mapping technique in flavor reformulation process.

Configurations: All the analyses were performed on a PC (windows 10, x64) by using Python (3.7.4) with Spyder IDE (4.1.5). The following modules are required: pandas (1.3.0), numpy (1.21.1), matplotlib (3.3.3), nltk (3.7), scikit-learn (0.23.2), network (2.6.3), pyvis (0.3.0)

Instructions 
Data folder contains two files. “flv_notes_inputs_demo.csv” is a demo dataset with 20 flavor ingredients (20% of original raw data of 100 flavor ingredients).  “ing_npmi_group.csv” file has NPMI scores of selected pairs of flavor ingredients (NPMI >= 0.55) and their corresponding cluster groups. This dataset can be directly imported to generate the flavor map. Script is available in code folder. A brief report is under report folder, which has more details about methods and results. High resolution figures are in the figures_flavormap folder.
